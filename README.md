## Drawer Menu

a multi-level drawer menu built with React, motion animations, and the shadcn ui. 
Open it via the `Open Menu` button or `Ctrl+O`/`⌘+O`, then navigate nested sections that animate as you drill in and out. The layout is optimized for mobile with guttered drawer edges and scales up to a centered panel on larger screens.***
